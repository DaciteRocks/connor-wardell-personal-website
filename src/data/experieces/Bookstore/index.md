While going to school at ASU I worked at the ASU Bookstore part time as a sales associate for the technology department. I created a program that reduced the time it took an employee to take inventory by 50% which I talk more about [here](http://connorwardell.com/blog/Python-Inventory-Automation/ "Python-Inventory-Automation").
