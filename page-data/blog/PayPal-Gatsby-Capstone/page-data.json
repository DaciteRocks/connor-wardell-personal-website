I decided to choose the PayPal project because it was using Gatsby which is an open-source frontend framework, and I had some experience with Gatsby the year prior working on a custom website. I wanted to gain more experience with web development in general and thought it would be more insightful to work with someone from a software company rather than some of the other options we were given.\nThe project was to build an ecommerce website generator that didn’t require any 3rd parties besides PayPal. It needed to be easy to use and set up and its database needed to be in markdown. The idea was that we wanted to give a non-technical business owner a free option to create a fully functioning ecommerce store. There were 5 of us computer science seniors working on the project.\nIt is currently located at: <a href=\"https://github.com/bbruns97/PayPal-Static-Site-Generator\">https://github.com/bbruns97/PayPal-Static-Site-Generator</a></p>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>\n<p>My main job on our group was working on the PayPal integration. I set up the payment system and connecting that to PayPals APIs. I set up cart functionality and integrated that with PayPal so that multiple items could be bought at the same time. </p>\n<p><strong>Agile</strong></p>\n<p>We followed Agile development practices with a 2-week sprint. We meet with PayPal once during each sprint to showcase our progress. We would alternate the Scrum Master so that we all got experience in the different roles of Agile development. We used Taiga to manage product backlogs and each sprint’s tasks. </p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Overall, it was a great project. I got a lot of experience working with Gastby, Javascript, and React. As well as experience using Agile. I also got experience working on a team. The final product was a success with it having all the features PayPal was looking for. Currently we are trying to get it moved onto the PayPal Github. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"PayPal Gatsby Capstone","date":"Jan 07, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/PayPal-Gatsby-Capstone/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/Python-Inventory-Automation/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Python Inventory Automation"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1023445677","3649515864","63159454"]}
